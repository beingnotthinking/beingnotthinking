And this is the story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside... just kidding. 

#### Where we started

Michaela and I spent nearly all of our lives in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. blah blah

#### Why Washington?
I made a very good friend while working at a startup in Chicago but after just a few months he accepted a job he could not refuse out in Seattle. It was very sad at the time but was enough to get me on an airplane for the first time. 

#### Where are we now

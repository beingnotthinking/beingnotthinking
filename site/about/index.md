### Who Are We? 
We are Patrick and Michaela Farwick. We are two ordinary people trying to live an extraordinary life, and firmly believe that you can too. 

### Why a blog? 
As someone (Patrick) who is long winded, a blog just makes more sense to me as a medium to share my thoughts and feelings than instagram or tiktok. 

### You're just like, doing this for the money... Maaaaannnnnn
5 Years ago you probably would have caught me. I was super focused on making truly as much money as I possibly could, constantly studying and working for promotions in a field where that could be very fruitful (tech). Once I started making real money (right around 100k USD a year) I realized it was not the thing that was going to make me happy, helping people is what makes me happy, so I would like to do that. 

So yes, eventually this blog, our content, etc will hopefully be community supported and/or supported via helping people more directly. That is because we need places to sleep and food to eat, just like everyone else :) 

Well, I hope you enjoyed this about page, check out our youtube videos and instagram for more light hearted travel influencer style content.

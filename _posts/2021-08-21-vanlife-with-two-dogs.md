Both Bosley and Lili are Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers. Patrick's family dog growing up was a wheaten because they are hypoallergenic and Patrick was quite allergic to dogs as a child. 

#### Bosley!

Bosley was our first dog and he joined our family in 2017, making him right around 5 years old. He has the classic wheaten traits of being very stubborn, but is also the snuggliest dog we have ever had. He is a very chill dog and often just likes to lay down outside or sit and watch windows or even the tv. 

#### Lilith!

Lilith, or Lili for short, joined our family December of 2019. We wanted to get Bosley a friend to hang out with during the day, but then Covid happened and we all ended up hanging every day. Lili is 2 years old and has a ton of personality. She is incredibly food driven which made her very easy to train and although we are still working through some of the social anxiety of being a covid puppy. 

#### The Highs and Lows of Vanlife with Dogs
We both agree that if we knew we were going to live in a van we would not have chosen to get dogs. But, since they were here first, we have tailored our van life living situation to make sure they are well taken care of. I think having dogs would be more of a hinderance if we liked being in cities, but we much prefer being in the middle of nowhere in the woods or desert, so the dogs can have a lot more freedom in hanging around and exploring with us. 

Although they can be a bit of a handful sometimes, we couldn't love our dogs more and they really do make our little family whole.

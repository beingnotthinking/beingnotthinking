Hello! Thank you for checking out our blog! And thank you for taking a little bit of time to get to know us better. 

#### Together
Together we are Patrick and Michaela Farwick. We met in a small town and like a lot of teenagers, fell in love. Unlike a large percentage of those teenagers, we have built an impulsive teenage marriage into a nearly 10 year relationship, 7 of which have been while married. Over these 10 years we have grown into people who arguably couldn't be further from the people we started as, but that is a story for a different day. 

#### Patrick
Howdy! It is always hard to give an introduction about yourself. Who exactly are you? Are you your name? Your career? Your past? Hard to say! Alan Watts describes a person as the patterns they often portray, so let's start there. 

The pattern I enjoy most is getting to know people. I love hearing about the different experiences and perspectives individuals have gained during their time on this Earth. In my experience, there is no more perfect a night than one spent having deep conversations with new or old friends.

I am currently on a journey to meet more people, make deeper connections, and experience life to the fullest. Living in a van is a means to that end. 

You can expect posts from me about spirituality, meditation, psychedelics, mental health, and of course, living in a van. 

I am a pretty open book and happy to share about my experiences, so if you ever feel the inkling to reach out, please do, I would love to talk!

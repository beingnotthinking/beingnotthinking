No Thanks!</h2><p>A main driving force around packing so light was not having to wait in baggage claim. Most airlines will let you bring on one carry on and one personal item, the carry on to throw in the overhead bins and the personal item to sit under the seat in front of you. If you can fit your whole life into just two bags (and be a person who hovers close to the boarding area well before it's your time to board) you can almost gaurantee your bags will be close by during the flight, and more importantly, close when getting off of the plane. This means you will not have to wait around baggage claim standing around hoping for your bag to finally show up. You can just head out the door or through customs if traveling internationally.</p><h2>What we Packed?</h2><p>This should come to you as no surprise if you saw the clip from our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bvh6_BpuDQ">Packing Video</a>, but we needed different things for our travels.</p><h3>Patrick</h3><p>Why am I in the same two shirts in every video we post? Well, it's because I have two shirts.</p><p>My carry on has really been optimized for making sure we have all of the audio and video gear we need to make content. This means I have really sacrificed quite a bit in the clothes department. It doesn't really bother me to just cycle underclothes (although I am seemingly wearing out my favorite shirt pretty quickly) as it sure makes the question of &quot;what am I going to wear today&quot; pretty easy.</p><p>I decided on a backpack (specifically an Osprey Farpoint 55) because I imagined it would be easier to travel around with... so far I am not totally convinced, but I think that will change as we really get moving around. When in airports I generally split the day bag off the main bag so it looks more like a carry on and a personal item, and although I have yet to recieve any trouble with it, it does make for a bit of an awkward moving experience which makes me envious of Michaela's rolling suitcase.</p><h3>Michaela</h3><p>This almost sounds like a joke after how much I had to downsize when it came to makeup and clothes, but compared to Patrick I definitely have a lot more options when it comes to what I am wearing. That being said, it took quite a bit of planning to figure out what I needed, what I could pick up anywhere, and what clothes really compact down into very little space.</p><p>I went with a suitcase mainly because I did not want a backpack and so far am glad I did. It is very nice to be able to strap my backpack onto my suitcase and just wheel it around.</p><h3>5 Tips on Packing to Travel the World</h3><ol><li><p>Pack Light!<br>It should almost go without saying, but you just do not need as much stuff as you think you do. I am not going to say you have to only have a single packback or if you check a bag you are a fool, but I have found the less stuff I have to worry about the better.</p></li><li><p>Have a place for what is important<br>Maybe it is just a bit of anxiety being new to this, but having a place where the passports <em>always</em> go makes us feel better. There are few things you can't replace if they get lost or damaged, but being without an identity sure makes life harder. A sub-tip here: Make photo copies of your passport to throw in your bag. It isn't quite a 1:1 fix if your passport gets lost, but I have heard it goes a long way at the consulate.</p></li><li><p>Buy Quality over Quantity<br>Whether it is your suitcase, backpack, clothes, or shoes, if you are not going to have very many of them, spend the extra cash to get what is <em>Nice</em>. Having a suitcase where a wheel falls off or a backpack where a strap breaks is just, not something that you will want to deal with. So save yourself some headache and get the best quality you can afford (and please note, quality does not always line up directly with price)</p></li><li><p>Don't bring everything you &quot;need&quot; at home<br>I think there is this weird feeling when about to leave for a long journey that the places you go will not have the things you need and 99% of the time that just is not the case. Bringing 3 small versions of your favorite shampoo or facewash may seem reasonable when about to leave for months, but when you walk around the store and see your favorite shampoo in all of its glory, you will wonder why you put these things in your bag that you had to pull out at every security checkpoint.</p></li><li><p>Be Organized<br>It can be packing cubes, vacuum seal bags, or just having your electronics here and liquids there, being organized makes it easy when you need to pull things out in the airport and makes sure you don't have too much &quot;miscellaneous&quot; belongings that seem to accumulate during your travels. We are still figuring out what our favorite methods are, but so far a camera bag and cable bag have gone a very long way in making our lives easier.</p></li></ol><nav class="pagination mb-1000" aria-label="Pagination"><ul class="items text-400 tablet:box-flex"></ul></nav></div></article><script type="application/ld+json">{
